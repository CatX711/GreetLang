This is a revamped version of the concept `Greetlang` programming language created by, me, of course. I have been very happy with my documentation over the language and all of my own "original" ideas. However, the key word is, `original`. I soon realised, that, very far into production of the language, most of my ideas had already been done by other people, `and I hadn't even realised`. This occured to me while trying out Rust, where I saw that you could specify the type of a variable if needed. I saw my code and thought, <br />

<br />

*Hey, that looks a lot like GreetLang!*


<br />

I looked back at my code. <br />

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 4; <-- Look here.
    println!("x is: {}", x); 
}
```

<br />
<br />

And back and my GreetLang. <br />

```c
let x: int = 6; <-- Look here,
let y: int = 7; <-- and here.

greet(x * 7)
```

If you can't see my point, look at the Rust code. When simplified it means `let x: int = 4`.

<br />
<br />

When I investigated more and more into GL and it's features, I kept on finding unoriginal ideas. So Greetlang `Plus`, is here to change that. Me personally, having spent so much work on that language, would like to pay it some justice after all my effort into essentially a harder version of Rust, C, and Python mixed together to vomit out some unoriginal ideas marketed as my own. I may be being a bit harsh on GreetLang, but I would like my language to be as original as possible (with some tried and tested elements from other languages, of course). If that means recreating the whole thing from the ground up, <br />
`I will do it.`

# Greetlang+ Documentation

<br />
<br />
<br />

Greetlang+ is a simple programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is an extension of Greetlang, which adds several new features such as support for functions with parameters, basic mathematical operations, as well as reworking the syntax to make it more easy to read and intuitive.


<br />
<br />
<br />

## Data Types

<br />
<br />

Greetlang+ supports the following data types:

    string: A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, e.g. "Hello, World!".
    number: A numeric value, e.g. 42.
    boolean: A value that is either true or false.
    undefined: A value that is used to represent an uninitialized variable or an absent value.

<br />
<br />

****

## Comments

GreetLang+ supports `single line` and `multi-line` comments.

<br />

**Single line:**

```
// Hey! This is a gl+ single line comment
```

<br />

**Multi line:**
```
/* I am a multi-line comment.
You can write across multiple lines,
and then end the comment like this -> */
```

<br />
<br />

****

## The Holy Semicolon 

`;` <-- This character, is responsible for the ***entire*** program not just bursting into flames. The semicolon is used for telling the compiler to stop executing the current line of code, and move on to the next one. You *must* end your lines of code with the semicolon `(as a reminder, this is the semicolon: ;)` otherwise the program will not run.
