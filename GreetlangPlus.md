>(Believe me, I tried to make the + look nice by adding some colour, but im just a kid, i cant do that!)

This is a revamped version of the concept `Greetlang` programming language created by, me, of course. I have been very happy with my documentation over the language and all of my own original ideas. However, the key word is, `original`. I soon realised, that, very far into production of the language, most of my ideas had already been done by other people, `and I hadn't even realised`. This occured to me while learning rust, where I saw that you could specify the type of a variable if needed. I saw my code and thought, <br />

<br />
*Hey, that looks a lot like GreetLang!*

<br />
I looked back at my code. <br />

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 4; // lets you change value of x throughout the program
    println("x is: {}", x)
}
```

<br />

And back and my GreetLang. <br />

```c
func addnums(num1 input: int, num2: int) rt integer {
  let sum: int = num1 + num2; <-- see the point im making? 
  return sum;
}
```

If you can see my point, look at the Rust code. When simplified it means `let x: int = 4"`.
