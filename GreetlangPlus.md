This is a revamped version of the concept `Greetlang` programming language created by, me, of course. I have been very happy with my documentation over the language and all of my own "original" ideas. However, the key word is, `original`. I soon realised, that, very far into production of the language, most of my ideas had already been done by other people, `and I hadn't even realised`. This occured to me while learning Rust, where I saw that you could specify the type of a variable if needed. I saw my code and thought, <br />

<br />

*Hey, that looks a lot like GreetLang!*


<br />

I looked back at my code. <br />

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 4; <-- Look here.
    println!("x is: {}", x); 
}
```

<br />
<br />

And back and my GreetLang. <br />

```c
let x: int = 6; <-- Look here,
let y: int = 7; <-- and here.

greet(x * 7)
```

If you can't see my point, look at the Rust code. When simplified it means `let x: int = 4`.

<br />
<br />

When I investigated more and more into GL and it's features, I kept on finding unoriginal ideas. So Greetlang `Plus`, is here to change that. Me personally, having spent so much work on that language, would like to pay it some justice after all my effort into essentially a harder version of Rust, C, and Python mixed together to vomit out some unoriginal ideas marketed as my own. I may be being a bit harsh on GreetLang, but I would like my language to be as original as possible (with some tried and tested elements from other languages, of course). If that means recreating the whole thing from the ground up, <br />
`I will do it.`

<br />
<br />

Get ready for a flurry of original ideas, and a mix of useful and effective syntax, because GreetLang+ is now here.
