# OOH WOWZA UPDATE!!!!!

<br />
<br />

Greetlang is now a reality in the brand new `Greetlang` *lite*

<br />
<bt />

It's a horredous language, but it works! Create a greetlang lite program by downloading the language, `(greetlangLite.py)`, and creating a seperate file with a `.gll` extension. Go to the end of `greetlangLite.py` and change the line of code:

<br />

```py
lexer = Lexer("hello.gll")
```

<br />

To have your file's name instead of the default `hello.gll`.

<br />
<br />

I am working my socks off to add more functionality like variables, function defining and calling, etcetera. But for now, you can only use the equivalent of print, `op();`. Thank you and have a nice day!

# GreetLang (Greet) and GreetLang+ (Greet+)

GreetLang (Greet) and GreetLang+ (Greet+) respectively are *concept* programming languages. 

<br />
<br />

They are purely fictional and just a side-project of mine. <br />
`Greet+` is a revamp of `Greet`, which has a lot more features, better syntax, etcetera.

<br />
<br />

JavaScript is used for syntax highlighting, resulting in GitHub falsely thinking that this is a JavaScript project. Oh well! ¯\\\__(ツ)__/¯

<br />
<br />
<br />

Please enjoy learning GreetLang+!

<br />

(GreetLang is old, outdated, and should not be learned. It is still up just because of the effort I put into it. Please read the GreetLang+ documentation instead, thank you :D )
