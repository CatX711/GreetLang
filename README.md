# GreetLang (Greet) and GreetLang+ (Greet+)

GreetLang (Greet) and GreetLang+ (Greet+) respectively are *concept* programming languages. 

<br />
<br />

They are purely fictional and just a side-project of mine. <br />
`Greet+` is a revamp of `Greet`, which has a lot more features, better syntax, etcetera.

<br />
<br />

JavaScript is used for syntax highlighting, resulting in GitHub falsely thinking that this is a JavaScript project. Oh well! ¯\\\__(ツ)_/¯

<br />
<br />
<br />

Please enjoy learning GreetLang+!

<br />

(GreetLang is old, outdated, and should not be learned. It is still up just because of the effort I put into it. Please read the GreetLang+ documentation instead, thank you :D )
